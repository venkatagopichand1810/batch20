db.users.find()



 db.createCollection("students")

 db.students.insertMany([
{_id: "venkat_4", name: "rama", age: 30, email: "rama@gmail.com", hobbies: ["music", "sports"], grade: "A"},
    {_id: "venkat_5", name: "john", age: 25, email: "john@gmail.com", hobbies: ["books", "travel"], grade: "B"},
    {_id: "venkat_6", name: "jack", age: 35, email: "jack@gmail.com", hobbies: ["sports", "travel"], grade: "C"},
    {_id: "venkat_7", name: "rama", age: 30, email: "rama@gmail.com", hobbies: ["music", "sports"], grade: "B"},
    {_id: "venkat_8", name: "john", age: 25, email: "john@gmail.com", hobbies: ["books", "travel"], grade: "C"},
    {_id: "venkat_9", name: "jack", age: 35, email: "jack@gmail.com", hobbies: ["sports", "travel"], grade: "D"},

 ])

 db.students.find()


 //find the users older than 25
 db.students.find({age : {$gte: 30}})

 //find the users with hobbies array containing "sports"
 db.students.find({hobbies: "sports"})


 //find the users with both "music and sports"
 db.students.find({hobbies: {$all: ["music", "sports"]}})

 //find the students where age is > 20 and grade is A 

 db.students.find({
    $and: [
        {age: {$gt: 20}},
        {grade: "A"}
    ]
 })



find the students with an A and B grade..

db.students.find({
    grade: {$in: ["A", "B"]}
})


find the students who don't have grade A

db.students.find({
    grade: {$ne: "A"}
});




i wanted to find student with letter start with R

db.students.find({
name: {$regex: /^r/}

})


i wanted to find the students ends with K


db.students.find({
name: {$regex: /k$/}

})


sort the students by age in ascending order
db.students.find().sort({age : 1})

db.students.find().sort({age : -1})


sort the students by grade in desc order


limit the students


skip first 2 students and show the next 3



find the students with an age > 20 or with grade of A

db.students.find({ $or: [{age: {$gt:34}}, {grade: "C"}]})



db.students.updateOne({name: "rama"}, {$set: {grade: "A+"}}); update query


db.students.updateMany({name: "rama"}, {$set: {grade: "A++"}});



delete one student

db.students.deleteMany({name: "jack"})


delete all the students with grade C
