Mongodb vs MySQL

mongodb -> NOSQL (Non relational Datbase)   
stores the data as documents JSON formate
schema-less document can have different structures
document based (key - value pairs)
MQL (mongodb query language)
faster for large datsets
will not support for joins

where we can use...
IOT applciation 
real time analytics
big data applications

it stores the data in BSON (Binary JSON)





mysql -> SQL (relational database)

-> stores the data in tables with rows and columns
-> fixed schema tables have predefined columns and data types
-> relational (tables with rows and columns)
-> SQL (structured query language)
-> SQL supports the joins

->CRM, ERP systems 

data stores in rows and columns
