Redux is the statement management library for the javacript applications.
Reduex helps us to manage the centralized state

key concepts of Redux

1) State...
    State refers the data that our application need to keep track
    Redux stores the state in a single object called store

2) Actions...
   Actions are plain javacript objects that tell what actions or what happend in the application

   Every action should have the type 

3) Reducers
    Reducer is the function that takes current state ands an action, and returns the new state

4) Store...
    The store hold the entire state of the application

5) Dispatch
    dispatch() is used to send an action to the Reducer

6) Selectors
    Selectors are functions used to extract the specific parts of the state



how redux works
1) dispatch an action
2) reducer process the action
3) state is going to update
4) react component will render

















useState -> simple states
useContext -> complex states
redux -> bigger complex allication state
