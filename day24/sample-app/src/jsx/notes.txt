html js -> jsx in react


what is JSX?
javascript XML which will allows us to write both HTML and Javascript with in the same js file in concise manner


Rules of jsx : we have to remember few rules w r t JSX
1) in react always create the file name with capital
2)while create the function(if you are creating the component) then function name should be capital letter
3) in jsx all the elements should contains one parent element or tag, so we can react fragments
4) jsx elements must be closed,,,,closing tag
5) attribute name should be in camelcase
